title: "Determined & Chill"
bio: |
  I'm a determined guy who also likes to stay chill. I've been training for about 7-8 months now, focused on losing weight and gaining muscle. My goal? Drop down to 190 while getting stronger and more athletic.
  
  My biggest motivation is David Goggins—that mindset of pushing past limits. Shoutout also to Coach George and fitness influencers like David Laid and Sam Sulek for getting me into the gym. Now I'm chasing PRs: 225 bench, 315 squat, 405 deadlift. The grind never stops.
